This repository contains a symbolic computation project written in the Wolfram Language (Mathematica).

## How to Use

- The files in the `notebooks/` folder (`*.nb`) are the main working notebooks.  
  You can **download and open them using Wolfram Desktop or Wolfram Cloud**.

- The files in the `output/` folder (`*.pdf`) are **read-only versions** of the notebooks.  
  These are useful if you **just want to view the content without running any code**.

## Requirements

- To run the notebooks: **Wolfram Mathematica**, or access via [Wolfram Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com)
- To view the PDFs: any standard PDF reader
